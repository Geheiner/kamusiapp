        <ul type="disc">
        <?php echo _('  <li>Short and sweet: A definition should be as brief as possible to explain the concept, but long enough to describe it fully. If the same word has <strong><em>different meanings</em></strong>, those are <strong><em>different concepts</em></strong> with different definitions. <strong><em>A definition</em></strong> in Kamusi only explains <strong><em>one concept</em></strong>.</li>'); ?>
        <?php echo _('  <li>Easy does it: Use the simplest words you can. Definitions should not force readers to jump around the dictionary more, unless technical terms are absolutely necessary.</li>'); ?>
        <?php echo _('  <li>No circles: Definitions should NOT contain the word that is being defined, nor its close relatives. <em>Happiness</em> is "A feeling of joy.", not "The feeling of being happy." Definitions should not be circular - we cannot now say <em>joy</em> is "A feeling of happiness."</li>'); ?>
        <?php echo _('  <li>No fluff: Do not start with "A term meaning", or "This is a", or "X refers to", etc. Style: Begin with a Capital letter and end with a period.</li>'); ?>
