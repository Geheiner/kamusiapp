"Definitions are explanations of what a word means. They are not single words "

"Short and sweet: A definition should be as brief as possible to explain the "
"concept, but long enough to describe it fully. If the same word has "
"different meanings, those are different concepts with different definitions- "
"a definition in Kamusi only explains *one* concept."

"No circles: Definitions should NOT contain the word that is being defined, "
