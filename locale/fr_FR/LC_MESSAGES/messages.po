"Definitions are explanations of what a word means. They are not single words "
"(those are synonyms). You can usually use a definition instead of the actual "
"word. Stick to these rules:"

msgid ""
"Short and sweet: A definition should be as brief as possible to explain the "
"concept, but long enough to describe it fully. If the same word has "
"different meanings, those are different concepts with different definitions- "
"a definition in Kamusi only explains *one* concept."

"No circles: Definitions should NOT contain the word that is being defined, "

"feeling of being happy.\" Definitions should not be circular - we cannot now "
"say \"joy\" is \"A feeling of happiness.\""

"No fluff: Do not start with \"A term meaning\", or \"This is a\", or \"X "
